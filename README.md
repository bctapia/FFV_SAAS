FFV_SaaS is most easily available via a webpage (insert webpage), hence the Software as a Service (SaaS) component in the name. This means there is no required user installation as everything is input via a simple graphical user interface. Our computers handle all the calculations. ```FFV_SaaS/SaaS``` folder contains the front and backend components required to make this service run.

The computational core of FFV_SaaS is available as a Python module, located in ```FFV_SaaS/ffv```. This core can be downloaded to perform FFV calculations locally, if desired.
